### Excitement and Anticipation: The Night Before and the First Morning
The night before my first day, I couldn’t sleep. My mind raced with excitement and nerves as I thought about what the day would bring. Would the office live up to the expectations? How would my colleagues be? What was the work culture like? I imagined it all, and as I woke up early the next morning, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of excitement and curiosity. I dressed my best, ready to make a great first impression. I reached the office 30 minutes before the scheduled start time, an indication of just how eager I was. As soon as I entered, I was greeted with warm smiles, chocolates, and flowers, making me feel right at home and welcomed into the Bitwise family.

Bitwise’s office is a magnificent 13-story building located along the Pune-Bengaluru highway, prominently displaying the Indian national flag. The grandeur of the building was only matched by the beauty of the interior. Walking through the entrance, I was immediately struck by the modern design and the positive vibe that permeated every corner. The layout was sleek and functional, with an open office space that encouraged collaboration and creativity. As I met the other members of the ASPIRE Batch, we quickly bonded, sharing our hopes and expectations for the journey ahead. Even though we were all new, it didn’t take long for us to form strong connections. These individuals, who started as colleagues, quickly became friends, and I knew we were all in for an incredible experience.
